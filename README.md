Spend at-least a week on [Part 3] questions, maybe 3-4 question everyday, dive deep, check other online resources (blog or YT Video) but make sure you understand them, if you answer them, you are good to go for almost all JavaScript interviews.

Chances are you know most of the answers in practical use case but you don’t know how to explain this to other, reading the blog will help you to structure your answers.
